    "##In our classification model, the four most important features for predicting rental prices are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms is a significant determinant of rental prices, as it directly correlates with the capacity and comfort of the living space. \n",
    "# Properties with more bedrooms typically cater to larger households, making them more desirable and, consequently, commanding higher rental rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Postcode: The postcode serves as an indicator of the property's location, which significantly influences rental values. \n",
    "# Areas with desirable postcodes often offer better access to amenities, transportation, and schools, \n",
    "# contributing to higher demand and increased rental prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Bathrooms: The quantity of bathrooms is another crucial factor impacting rental pricing.\n",
    "#  A higher number of bathrooms enhances convenience for tenants, \n",
    "# especially in larger households, and is often seen as a desirable feature that can justify a premium in rental costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Parking Spaces: The availability of parking spaces is a vital consideration in many regions, \n",
    "# particularly in urban settings where parking can be scarce. \n",
    "# Properties that offer designated parking tend to attract tenants who prioritize this convenience, \n",
    "# thereby increasing the potential rental value."
